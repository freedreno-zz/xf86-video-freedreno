/**
 * PrepareComposite() sets up the driver for doing a Composite operation

 * @param pMaskPicture mask picture
 * @param pDstPicture destination Picture
 * @param pSrc source pixmap

 *
 * This call should set up the driver for doing a series of Composite
 * operations, as described in the Render protocol spec, with the given
 * pSrcPicture, pMaskPicture, and pDstPicture.  The pSrc, pMask, and
 * pDst are the pixmaps containing the pixel data, and should be used for
 * setting the offset and pitch used for the coordinate spaces for each of
 * the Pictures.
 *
 * Notes on interpreting Picture structures:
 * - The Picture structures will always have a valid pDrawable.
 * - The Picture structures will never have alphaMap set.
 * - The mask Picture (and therefore pMask) may be NULL, in which case the
 *   operation is simply src OP dst instead of src IN mask OP dst, and
 *   mask coordinates should be ignored.
 * - pMarkPicture may have componentAlpha set, which greatly changes
 *   the behavior of the Composite operation.  componentAlpha has no effect
 *   when set on pSrcPicture or pDstPicture.
 *   Note: componentAlpha means to treat each R/G/B channel as an independent
 *   alpha value for the corresponding channel in the src.
 * - The source and mask Pictures may have a transformation set
 *   (Picture->transform != NULL), which means that the source coordinates
 *   should be transformed by that transformation, resulting in scaling,
 *   rotation, etc.  The PictureTransformPoint() call can transform
 *   coordinates for you.  Transforms have no effect on Pictures when used
 *   as a destination.
 * - The source and mask pictures may have a filter set.  PictFilterNearest
 *   and PictFilterBilinear are defined in the Render protocol, but others
 *   may be encountered, and must be handled correctly (usually by
 *   PrepareComposite failing, and falling back to software).  Filters have
 *   no effect on Pictures when used as a destination.
 * - The source and mask Pictures may have repeating set, which must be
 *   respected.  Many chipsets will be unable to support repeating on
 *   pixmaps that have a width or height that is not a power of two.
 *
 * If your hardware can't support source pictures (textures) with
 * non-power-of-two pitches, you should set #EXA_OFFSCREEN_ALIGN_POT.
 *
 * Note that many drivers will need to store some of the data in the driver
 * private record, for sending to the hardware with each drawing command.
 *
 * The PrepareComposite() call is not required.  However, it is highly
 * recommended for performance of antialiased font rendering and performance
 * of cairo applications.  Failure results in a fallback to software
 * rendering.
